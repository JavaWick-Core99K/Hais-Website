		<h2>Why we created this</h2>
		<h3>We decided to create this website due to a protest about racism and sexual assault that occurred at our high school. When this protest occurred hundreds of complaints were released all at once that weren't talked about as much beforehand.</h3> 
	
		<h2>Our Beliefs</h2>
		<h3> We believe that feeling understood through this website is our main priority. Our next goal is being able to give people the knowledge to change their situations for the better if possible.</h3>
