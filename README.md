# Hais-Website

- Created in HTML and CSS.


Inspiration:
We created this website due to our own troubles at our highschool. Each of us noticed white privilege in varying degrees throughout our highschool careers but it didn’t affect us very much. Then, a month ago, a campaign started against white privilege and sexual harrasment at our school and hundreds of complaints were filed in a span of two weeks. While we understood the problem, we questioned ourselves about the reasons why there was a surge of complaints that weren’t heard about before. We realized it was due to the inability to connect with others who had experienced the same things. That’s why we created this app to allow those who experience systematic oppression, gender inequality, racism, etc,  to talk with others and to hopefully gain more knowledge about what they can do to change their situation through professionals and other students.


Challenges:
The biggest challenge we had was implementing a comfortable atmosphere through the website and thinking of the design layout.


What we learned from this project:
We are usually backend developers so we decided to try a front-end project for this hackathon and we learned how hard it is to design an aesthetically pleasing website that fits the atmosphere we were trying to achieve.


What's next for this website:
After this hackathon we plan to create a login system for the users. Then we plan to create a mobile friendly version of the website. Our next major plan is to implement a message system within the app to ensure the privacy of the text messages.
